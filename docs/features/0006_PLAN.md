# Fix Form Cutoff Issue in BottomTabsWrapper Layout

## Problem Description
The submit form (and other forms) gets cut off at the bottom when the content exceeds the available viewport height. This occurs because the `BottomTabsWrapper` component in `App.tsx` uses `overflow-hidden` which prevents scrolling when content is taller than the container.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue stems from the layout structure in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
function BottomTabsWrapper() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen pb-16 flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
        <Outlet />
      </div>
      <BottomTabs />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The problems are:
1. `h-screen` sets a fixed viewport height
2. `pb-16` adds bottom padding for tabs (4rem)
3. `overflow-hidden` prevents content from being scrollable
4. When form content exceeds available height, it gets clipped

## Technical Solution
Modify the BottomTabsWrapper layout to allow vertical scrolling while maintaining the bottom tabs positioning.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Update BottomTabsWrapper in App.tsx
- Change `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-y-auto` on the main container
- Keep `overflow-hidden` on the inner content area to prevent layout issues
- Ensure proper scrolling behavior for form content

#### 2. Form Container Adjustments
- Ensure forms have proper min-height constraints
- Test scrolling behavior on different screen sizes
- Verify bottom tabs remain fixed at bottom

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Core Layout Fix
1. Modify BottomTabsWrapper container classes:
   - Change `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-y-auto`
   - Add `min-h-0` to ensure proper flex behavior
   - Keep inner container as `overflow-hidden` to prevent double scrollbars

2. Test the change with the SubmitEvent form to ensure:
   - Form content scrolls properly
   - Bottom tabs remain visible and fixed
   - No layout shift occurs

#### Phase 2: Responsive Testing
1. Test on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Verify form fields remain accessible when scrolled
3. Ensure SeriesForm component works properly in scrollable container
4. Test with different form lengths (short vs long forms)

#### Phase 3: Additional Layout Improvements
1. Add proper spacing constraints to prevent layout collapse
2. Ensure consistent behavior across all routes using BottomTabsWrapper
3. Test edge cases like very long forms or small viewport heights

## Files to Modify
- `ui/src/App.tsx` - BottomTabsWrapper component layout classes

## Expected Outcome
- Forms will be fully scrollable when content exceeds viewport height
- Bottom tabs remain fixed at the bottom of the screen
- No visual cutoff of form elements or submit buttons
- Consistent behavior across all form-based routes

## Testing Criteria
- SubmitEvent form scrolls properly on mobile devices
- SeriesForm component is fully accessible when expanded
- Bottom navigation tabs remain visible during scrolling
- No horizontal scrollbars appear
- Form submission works from any scroll position
