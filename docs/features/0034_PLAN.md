# Feature Plan: Committee Tag Filter Dropdown

## Overview

Add a committee tag filter dropdown positioned below the existing event type filter. This feature enhances event filtering by allowing users to filter events by specific committees while maintaining consistent UX across all views (Map, List, Calendar) through local storage persistence. Committee tags are always displayed in ALL CAPS regardless of input format, with a standardized naming convention.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**Create New Committees Table**
- Add `committees` table to store unique committee names and slugs
- Include fields: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Add index on `slug` for efficient lookups
- Add index on `name` for case-insensitive searches
- Store normalized ALL CAPS committee names
- Store URL-friendly slugs derived from normalized names

**Committee Naming Convention**
- Strict format validation with user guidance during submission
- **Allowed formats:**
  - Regional committees: "NECYPAA", "MSCYPAA", "RISCYPAA", "NHSCYPAA"
  - Advisory committees: "NECYPAA ADVISORY", "MSCYPAA ADVISORY"
  - BID committees: "RHODE ISLAND BID FOR NECYPAA", "MASSACHUSETTS BID FOR YPAA"
- **Not allowed:** "NECYPAA EXECUTIVE", "THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CONFERENCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN AA"
- Remove leading "THE" from BID committees for deduplication
- All committee names normalized to ALL CAPS regardless of input
- User reminders during submission to follow naming conventions
- Prevent duplicate committees through normalization

**Migration Strategy**
- Create initial migration file for committees table
- Add migration logic to populate committees from existing events data
- Normalize all existing committee names to ALL CAPS during migration
- Generate slugs from normalized names
- Remove all test data and reseed with properly formatted committee names
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing committee fields

### 2. API Endpoints

**New Endpoints**
- `GET /api/v1/committees` - Retrieve all available committees for dropdown options (returns normalized ALL CAPS names)
- `POST /api/v1/committees/sync` - Sync committees collection with new entries from events (normalizes input to ALL CAPS)

**Enhanced Existing Endpoints**
- Update `/api/v1/browse` to support committee filtering alongside existing parameters
- Update `/api/v1/events` to support committee filtering
- Update `/api/v1/occurrences` to support committee filtering
- Add committee name normalization in event creation/update endpoints

**Input Validation & Normalization**
- Strict validation for committee name formats with user guidance
- **Valid patterns:**
  - Regional: /^[A-Z]+YPAA$/ (e.g., "NECYPAA", "MSCYPAA", "RISCYPAA")
  - Advisory: /^[A-Z]+YPAA ADVISORY$/ (e.g., "NECYPAA ADVISORY", "MSCYPAA ADVISORY")
  - BID committees: /^[A-Z\s]+BID FOR Y?PAA$/ (e.g., "RHODE ISLAND BID FOR NECYPAA")
- **Reject patterns:** "NECYPAA EXECUTIVE", "THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CONFERENCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN AA"
- Remove leading "THE" from BID committee submissions
- Provide user feedback/reminders for invalid formats during submission
- Normalize all committee inputs to ALL CAPS before storage
- Generate slugs from normalized names for URL-friendly identifiers

### 3. Frontend Components

**CommitteeFilter Component**
- Create `CommitteeFilter.tsx` component with dropdown UI
- Position below existing `EventTypeFilter` component
- Use ShadCN Select component for consistent styling
- Include "ALL COMMITTEES" default option (displayed in ALL CAPS)
- Support multi-select functionality
- Display all committee names in ALL CAPS regardless of stored format
- Sort committees alphabetically by normalized name

**Display Consistency**
- Ensure all committee names displayed in ALL CAPS across entire application
- Update event detail views to show committee names in ALL CAPS
- Update event creation/editing forms to normalize input to ALL CAPS
- Maintain ALL CAPS display in filter dropdown, event cards, and detail views

**Integration Points**
- Integrate into `MapIndex.tsx` FilterContext
- Update `MapView.tsx`, `ListView.tsx`, `CalendarView.tsx` to include committee filter
- Maintain consistent positioning across all views

### 4. State Management

**FilterContext Updates**
- Add `selectedCommittees` state (string array of committee slugs)
- Add `setSelectedCommittees` function
- Add `availableCommittees` state for dropdown options
- Add `committeesLoading` and `committeesError` states

**Local Storage Persistence**
- Store selected committees in localStorage with key `selected-committees`
- Implement persistence logic similar to existing filter patterns
- Restore selections on component mount
- Clear localStorage when "All Committees" is selected

### 5. Data Flow

**Committee Sync Algorithm**
1. Query events for unique committee/committee_slug combinations
2. Remove leading "THE" from BID committee names for deduplication
3. Normalize all committee names to ALL CAPS format
4. Validate names against strict patterns (regional, advisory, BID only)
5. Reject invalid formats like "NECYPAA EXECUTIVE" or long descriptive names
6. Generate slugs from normalized names
7. Compare with existing committees table
8. Insert new committees not already present
9. Update last_seen timestamp for existing committees
10. Return updated committees list with ALL CAPS names

**Data Seeding & Migration**
1. Add test_data flag to events and committees tables for easy cleanup
2. Remove all existing test data from events and committees tables before seeding
3. Create large seed dataset (~100 events) with diverse committee representations
4. Ensure all seed committee names follow ALL CAPS convention and validation rules
5. Include comprehensive set of regional committees: NECYPAA, MSCYPAA, RISCYPAA, NHSCYPAA, etc.
6. Include BID-related committees and advisory committees
7. Distribute events across different regions and committee types for realistic testing
8. Include approximate US-based lat/long coordinates for all test events
9. Update seed scripts to prevent duplicates and maintain ALL CAPS format for future data
10. Mark all seeded data with test_data flag for easy identification and removal

**Address & Geolocation Handling**
- **Address Storage:** Preserve original address components for display (address, city, state_prov, country, postal)
- **Geolocation Approach:** Store lat/long in schema, perform geolocation lookup after submission
  - Use external API (MapBox/Google) for coordinate lookup during event submission
  - Store coordinates in existing latitude/longitude fields
  - Handle API failures gracefully with fallback coordinates
- **Test Data Handling:** Use approximate US-based lat/long coordinates for seed data
  - Don't require perfect accuracy for test events
  - Use coordinates roughly corresponding to address locations
  - Ensure test data has valid coordinates for mapping functionality
- **Display Requirements:** Original address must be available for event details view
- **Mapping Optimization:** Lat/long needed for efficient map rendering and distance calculations
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure address components are properly normalized and stored

**Filter Application**
1. Apply committee filter to API requests using normalized slugs
2. Combine with existing event type filters
3. Display committee names in ALL CAPS in filter results
4. Maintain filter state across view switches
5. Update map markers, list items, and calendar events accordingly

### 6. UI/UX Implementation

**Dropdown Design**
- Use consistent styling with existing filters
- Include committee name in ALL CAPS format
- Include optional count of events per committee
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Show loading state while fetching committees
- Handle empty state when no committees available
