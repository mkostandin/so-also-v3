# Event List Layout Improvements

## Feature Description
Fix the event list layout issues where the list doesn't utilize the full page height and the "Events by Distance" title appears too close to the left edge without proper spacing. Also address any width issues for mobile devices.

## Files to Modify

### ui/src/routes/ListView.tsx
- **Issue 1**: Height constraint prevents full utilization of available space
- **Issue 2**: Add proper padding/margin to the title container for left spacing
- **Issue 3**: Address mobile width issues if present
- **Current problematic elements**:
  - Line 185: `<div className="max-h-[60vh] md:max-h-[70vh] overflow-y-auto">` - limits height to 60-70% of viewport
  - Lines 164-173: Title container lacks left padding/margin
  - Line 156: `<div className="mx-auto max-w-3xl">` - may cause width issues on mobile
- **Proposed changes**:
  - Replace height constraints with full height utilization using flexbox
  - Add `pl-4` or `px-4` to the title container for proper left spacing
  - Adjust width constraints for better mobile experience

### ui/src/routes/MapIndex.tsx
- **Issue**: Parent layout may constrain content area height
- **Current problematic elements**:
  - Line 142: `<div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">` - content area container
- **Proposed changes**:
  - Ensure content area uses full available height
  - Maintain proper flex layout structure

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze current height constraints**
   - Identify how height is currently limited in the component hierarchy
   - Determine optimal height utilization strategy

2. **Update ListView.tsx height management**
   - Remove or adjust `max-h-[60vh] md:max-h-[70vh]` constraints
   - Implement full height usage with proper overflow handling
   - Add proper horizontal padding to title container

3. **Update mobile width handling**
   - Adjust `max-w-3xl` constraint for better mobile experience
   - Ensure responsive behavior across all device sizes

4. **Update MapIndex.tsx layout (if needed)**
   - Ensure parent container properly supports full height usage
   - Maintain visual consistency between header and content

5. **Test responsive behavior**
   - Verify layout works across different device sizes and orientations
   - Ensure title spacing is consistent and visually appealing
   - Confirm full height utilization on all devices

## Expected Behavior
- Event list should utilize full available height on all devices
- "Events by Distance" title should have proper left margin/padding
- Layout should remain readable and visually balanced across all device sizes
- Mobile width issues should be resolved for better usability
- Maintain existing functionality and responsiveness
- **NEW**: List should remain scrollable when content exceeds available height
