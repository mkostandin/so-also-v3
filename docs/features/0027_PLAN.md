# Feature: Fix Event Type Filter Flashing in Calendar View

## Brief Description
Fix the jarring UX issue where the event type filter pills flash and reload when switching to calendar view. The filter works smoothly in map and list views but causes visual disruption in calendar view due to component unmounting during loading states.

## Current State Analysis
- EventTypeFilter works consistently in MapView and ListView without flashing
- CalendarView shows EventTypeFilter only after loading completes, causing flash effect
- useCalendarEvents hook refetches data when selectedEventTypes changes, triggering loading state
- ListView maintains filter visibility during loading states as a better UX pattern

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CalendarView Loading State Enhancement
**Files to modify:**
- `ui/src/routes/CalendarView.tsx` - Modify loading state rendering

**Implementation:**
1. Update the loading return statement to include EventTypeFilter and DistanceFilter components
2. Keep filters visible during data fetching to prevent unmount/remount cycles
3. Only show skeleton loading for calendar grid content, not filter controls
4. Match the pattern used in ListView for consistent UX across views

### Phase 2: Verification and Testing
**Files to verify:**
- `ui/src/routes/CalendarView.tsx` - Confirm filters remain visible during loading
- `ui/src/routes/ListView.tsx` - Ensure consistent behavior patterns
- `ui/src/components/EventTypeFilter.tsx` - Verify component stability

**Implementation:**
1. Test filter interactions during calendar data loading
2. Verify smooth transitions between filter states
3. Confirm no regression in MapView and ListView behavior
4. Test edge cases like rapid filter changes and network delays
