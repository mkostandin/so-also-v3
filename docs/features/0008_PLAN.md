# Enhanced Conference Implementation with Pictures, Website Links, and Notifications

## Problem Description
Current conference implementation lacks visual appeal, comprehensive session types, program agenda functionality, and notification options. Users cannot easily discover conference content, view program schedules, or subscribe to topics of interest.

## Current State Analysis
- Basic conference cards with minimal information
- Limited session types (workshop, panel, main, marathon only)
- No program agenda view
- Missing conference images and website links
- No topic-based notification system for conferences
- Sessions lack detailed information display

## Technical Solution

### Phase 1: Enhanced Conference Display
1. **Update ConferenceCard component** to include:
   - Conference images with fallback display
   - Website link buttons
   - Program URL links
   - Hotel map links
   - Enhanced date/time display

2. **Add conference image support**:
   - Add imageUrls field to conference schema
   - Implement image upload/display in conference creation
   - Add fallback images for conferences without pictures

### Phase 2: Extended Session Types and Display
1. **Expand session type enum** to include:
   - workshop, panel, main, marathon (existing)
   - dance, event, main_meeting (new)

2. **Enhance SessionCard component** with:
   - Session type badges with colors
   - Room information display
   - Description preview
   - Time duration calculation
   - Speaker information (if available)

3. **Add session filtering** by type in conference detail view

### Phase 3: Program Agenda Implementation
1. **Create ProgramAgenda component** with:
   - Daily schedule view
   - Time-slot based layout
   - Room-based organization
   - Session type filtering
   - Search functionality

2. **Add agenda navigation** in conference detail page
3. **Implement responsive design** for mobile agenda viewing

### Phase 4: Conference Topic Notifications
1. **Extend NotificationsToggles component** to support:
   - Conference-specific topics
   - Session type topics (panels, workshops, dances, etc.)
   - Committee-specific notifications
   - Custom topic creation

2. **Add notification preferences** to conference detail page
3. **Implement topic subscription** storage and management

### Phase 5: Conference Creation and Management
1. **Enhance conference submission form** with:
   - Image upload functionality
   - Website URL fields
   - Program URL fields
   - Hotel map URL fields

2. **Add session management** in conference admin interface
3. **Implement session creation workflow**

## Implementation Requirements

### Database Schema Updates
- Add imageUrls array to conferences table
- Expand session_type enum with new types
- Add website_url, program_url, hotel_map_url fields to conferences
- Consider adding speaker information to sessions

### API Endpoints
- Update conference endpoints to return new fields
- Add session filtering endpoints
- Implement notification preference endpoints
- Add image upload endpoints for conferences

### UI Components
- Enhanced ConferenceCard with images and links
- Improved SessionCard with type badges and details
- New ProgramAgenda component
- Extended NotificationsToggles for conference topics
- Conference submission form enhancements
