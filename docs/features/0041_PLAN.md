# Event Details Page Notifications UI Update

## Feature Description
Update the committee notifications toggle on the event details page to remove the description sub-text under the "Get [COMMITTEE] Notifications" headline and modify the tooltip text for better user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Modify
- `ui\src\components\CommitteeNotificationsToggle.tsx`

### Changes Required

#### 1. Remove Description Sub-text
- Remove the paragraph element containing "Receive notifications for {committeeName.toUpperCase()} events and updates" (lines 70-72)
- This will make the component more compact, fitting on one line or two if the committee name is long

#### 2. Update Tooltip Text
- Change tooltip text from "On the day of the event you will get notification of the event and conference."
- To: "On the day of committee events, you will receive notifications."
- Keep the existing "Must install app" functionality and installation button

#### 3. Layout Adjustments
- Ensure the toggle switch and info icon remain properly aligned after removing the description text
- Maintain responsive design for both mobile and desktop views
- Preserve the existing styling and spacing for the toggle switch functionality

### Implementation Notes
- The headline "Get {committeeName.toUpperCase()} Notifications" remains unchanged
- All existing functionality (localStorage persistence, PWA installation, mobile/desktop tooltips) is preserved
- No database changes or API modifications required
- This is a pure UI/UX improvement with no breaking changes
