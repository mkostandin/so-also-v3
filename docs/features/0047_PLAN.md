### Feature: Fix mobile scrolling on events details page

**Context**: On small devices, users can no longer mobile scroll on the events details page. Investigation revealed that EventDetail is a separate full-page route, not nested under MapIndex, requiring its own scroll container architecture.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- EventDetail route (`/app/e/:id`) is a separate full-page route, not part of MapIndex
- EventDetail was treated as if it should integrate with MapIndex's scroll container
- Missing dedicated scroll container for the EventDetail route
- Root container (`#root`) constrained to `height: 100vh` preventing expansion
- EventDetail layout constrained by flex assumptions from MapIndex integration

**Technical Implementation**:

**1. Add dedicated scroll container for EventDetail route**
- Create App.tsx wrapper with `h-screen overflow-y-auto scroll-touch scroll-pan-y scrollbar-stable overscroll-none`
- This provides the scroll container specifically for EventDetail pages
- Ensures EventDetail has its own scroll context separate from MapIndex

**2. Fix root container constraints**
- Change `#root` from `height: 100vh` to `min-height: 100vh` in App.css
- Allows content to expand beyond viewport when needed
- Maintains minimum viewport height for proper layout

**3. Clean up EventDetail layout**
- Remove flex constraints (`flex-1 min-h-0`) since it's no longer a flex child
- Allow natural height flow for content expansion
- Ensure EventDetail can grow beyond viewport height

**4. Verify scrolling behavior**
- Test vertical scrolling works smoothly on mobile
- Ensure menu button remains touchable and functional
- Confirm no interference with other app views (List/Map/Calendar)
- Test on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome

**Files to modify**:
- `ui/src/App.tsx` - Add scroll container wrapper for EventDetail route
- `ui/src/App.css` - Fix root container height constraints
- `ui/src/routes/EventDetail.tsx` - Clean up layout constraints

**Expected behavior after fix**:
- Event details page scrolls smoothly on mobile devices
- Menu button remains functional with proper touch priority
- No interference with natural scrolling gestures
- Consistent behavior with other app views (List/Map/Calendar)

**Risk mitigation**:
- Test thoroughly on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Ensure back button navigation still works properly
- Verify image gallery lightbox doesn't break
- Confirm no regressions in desktop behavior

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETED & TESTED
- ✅ Root cause identified: EventDetail was a separate route needing its own scroll container
- ✅ App.tsx wrapper added with `h-screen overflow-y-auto` for EventDetail route
- ✅ EventDetail layout cleaned up (removed flex constraints)
- ✅ Substantial content added to ensure scrollable overflow
- ✅ All debugging code cleaned up
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Scrolling works on both mobile and desktop
- ✅ Other views remain unaffected
